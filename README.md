# use-debounce & use-throttle

As a result of my research of debouncing and throttling in React, I wrote two hooks **useDebounce** and **useThrottle** that could easily solve the problem.

## debounce & throttle
**Debounce** and **Throttle** functions have been rewritten with **trailing** and **leading** options.
